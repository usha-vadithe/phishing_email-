# Phishing Email Analysis – Cyber Security Internship Task 2

## Sample Email:
From: alert@paypai-security.com  
Subject: Urgent Action Required – Account Locked

Dear Valued Customer,

We have detected suspicious activity on your PayPal account. As a security measure, we have temporarily limited your access.

To restore access, please verify your account details by clicking the link below:

 https://secure-paypai-login.com/verify

Please complete this process within the next 12 hours to avoid permanent account suspension.

Sincerely,  
PayPal Security Center

## Phishing Indicators:

1. **Spoofed Sender Address**:
   - Email is from "paypai-security.com" instead of "paypal.com"
   - The domain is misspelled (Paypai instead of PayPal)

2. **Suspicious Link**:
   - Link is "https://secure-paypai-login.com" (not PayPal)
   - Looks official, but fake domain

3. **Urgent Language**:
   - Uses scare tactics: “permanent account suspension”
   - Pushes the user to act quickly

4. **Generic Greeting**:
   - Says “Dear Valued Customer” instead of using the recipient’s name

5. **Branding Issues**:
   - No PayPal logo, signature, or contact info

## Conclusion:
This is a classic phishing email. It uses domain spoofing, urgency, and fear to trick users into clicking a malicious link and providing sensitive login credentials. Users should delete such emails immediately and report them to their service provider.
